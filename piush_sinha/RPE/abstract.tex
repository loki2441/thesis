This paper presents an overview of container orchestration tools and its basic features. In the paper, we have discussed the architecture and various features of Apache's Mesos, Google's Kubernetes, Docker's Swarm, CoreOS's Fleet and Amazon's ECS followed by their comparison. We have also discussed related open issues and proposed our approach to solve them.
